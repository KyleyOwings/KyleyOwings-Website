        <div class="subheading mb-5">Art Historyüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Kyley Owings. I am an Art History major at the University of California, Riverside. In my current professional state, I have no job experience and am currently unemployed. I mainly do personal work and often pursue different types of commission work, which often includes digital painting and designing for other customers who find my artwork remarkable and also compensate me for my commission artwork pieces. 
 I'm currently working on personal projects to improve myself as a freelance graphic artist. Some projects include working on Comic book strips and illustrations to build up my art portfolio and presence online. I'm the creator of the comical and coming-of-age story entitled ‚ÄúCactus Burglar‚Äù and it is self-published on the freelance platform called Webtoons. I've been creating art for eight to nine years now and will continue to pursue new art opportunities and outlooks within the art community to branch out my creativity and artistry skills.For some background, I was a self-taught artist at the starting age of twelve. I have loved to draw and paint in different aspects and stages of my life. I began my artistic journey with inspiration from everyday modernity and the people around me. I take visual creativity from understanding different relationships and human dynamics and use it as fuel for my art pieces. Straying from my local environment and the people that I surround myself with has challenges me to observe the world differently as life reflects back into my work, for example, many interactions I have had in college has poured into aspiring goals and new passions for me and transformed into a moving drive for creating new artwork.I make an effort to use nostalgic memories and things from the past when creating new art pieces. I take inspiration from old photographs, television shows, and hobbies that intertwine with my artwork that of which sparks relatable emotions and renewed ambitions to incorporate new fresh ideas after reflecting on the past and moving to the present. Once I do that, I have new innovative ideas and I attempt to bring my out-of-the-box thinking into consideration when it comes to my artistic creations. <br><br>

         My primary focus is to capture my viewers with uniqueness and visual relatability within my artwork. One of the main sources of inspiration that I draw from can be recognized from different forms of pop-culture media. Some examples of that would be: Anime, Comic Books, Computer Video Games, and Digital Photographs. I start my creative process by implementing some of these elements embedded in my art style and contrasting their characteristics to relatable real-life scenarios. My original stories have elements of character arc build-ups and a cohesive understanding of character development through reflective storytelling that is conveyed through my illustrations as well.I have skills in creating in both traditional and digital art forms and mediums. I expand my art skills by trying out different art mediums to broaden my art scope with new exposure to different art practices. Most mediums I have hand-on experience and familiarity with would be: watercolor paint, acrylic paint, gouache paint, different mixed-medium paper textures, online graphic design programs, character development & design, clothing art design, sculptural clay creations, and many more creative outlets to list from.One of my main interests is graphic design and animation. To express my artistic career with media online, I have worked with top-tier, highly proficient art programs like Procreate, Clip Studio Paint Pro, FireAlapca, Flipaclip, and Canva to build my art portfolio with different aspects of drawing and painting digitally. One of the reasons I love to create art projects to influence other artists and young creators to create thought-provoking artwork that inspires many of the artists that may come after them. Understanding artistry is a difficult path, but it is worth the effort, time, and dedication to look at and understand it. That is why I decided to major in Art History to branch out my understanding of what makes art worth people's time and the history that goes into understanding the innovativeness and development that the term ‚Äúart‚Äù holds throughout history. One of my artistic goals was to invoke passion and nostalgia within those who are invested in my innovative and creative ideas. I wanted to use my knowledge of maintaining art and describing the intricate details about it to expand my worldview of how art where it holds its place within the present day and digital age. 
<br><br>

        I took some classes, such as Art History 189, which covered topics in Contemporary art, and Art History 182, which covered Visual Art and Visual Theory after 1945. Professor Elizabeth Kotz taught both Art History classes at the University of California Riverside. I earned a 90% passing grade. Taking both art history classes helped me develop different experiences and analytical thinking skills to interpret artworks throughout the years.
UCR classes, ‚ÄúArt History Contemporary Visual Art‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Theory After 1945‚Äù, allowed me to master the skills of collaboration work and teamwork through the shared efforts and talents of other classmates as students were split up into groups. It helped me to hone my skills of paying attention to details while viewing a masterpiece and elevate my problem-solving skills while writing essay projects. My critical thinking skills when tasked to do set roles and participation, alongside my adaptability and flexibility in a fast academic setting, have critically developed my talents for coming up with logical and well-thought-out decisions. I learned countless different mediums that has influenced artists to create masterpieces become aesthetically pleasing over time. Those courses taught me how contemporary and visual art has significantly changed how it is viewed and understood throughout the decades. The environment in which art emerges has significantly changed the way it is viewed and looked at in present-day art museums. I took the knowledge I gained throughout my time at the University of Riverside and applied that to my inspirational daily practices in my creative pursuits.  I‚Äôve learned to understand how other artist's creations remain a legacy within modern art historians, and it has inspired me to desire the same effect that legacy art pieces conspire. Creating an art piece that impactfully lasts on my viewers throughout decades and brings them to a higher resolution concerning my paintings and projects. An additional asset that I have to bring to any workplace is my language experience with American Sign Language. I happened to pass multiple American Sign Language classes at Saddleback College, and I cleared each three-stage class that the college had to offer. One passion that I want to pursue in the future is to take on bigger projects and expand my talents to a higher level by developing my skills in making illustrations and animations by becoming a full-time Graphic designer or illustrator of a potential award-winning novelist or award-winning children's illustration books.

 I admire multiple artists who are considered professionals who are inside of the commercial art field, traditional art field, and digital creators‚Äìall of whom I have grown strongly inspired to develop new techniques in art style and storytelling. One artist in particular who holds a warm candle over my heart happens to be the American cartoonist and author Charles M. Schulz. He‚Äôs a creator of fabulous works. One of his most famous works also happens to be my favorite newspaper comic that he has released titled, The Peanuts. He has also released an award-winning television show called The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, starring a little boy named Charlie Brown and his closest best friend/pet dog, Snoopy. Together, they face life problems contemplating different emotions and logic with witty, sarcastic notions and thoughtful opinions on everyday life. The characters in the franchise strive to cope with the hard knocks of childhood through consistent light-hearted scenarios and comedy to balance out pessimistic views and even optimistic values of living. Watching The Peanuts has brought the full nuance of bitter-sweet nostalgia into my artwork, which I am certain one will find from a quick look through my portfolio.  My artwork strives to deliver a familiar feeling of closeness and relatability that speaks to the people who view it. I found that the characters' personalities I have observed are well-rounded and invoke some inspiration to create my characters with the same type of charisma and charm that brings my expressive pictures and motion characters to life. By taking the expressiveness captured and created by many of the works inspired by Schulz's Peanuts franchise, I decided to apply that as fuel for creating daily clothing wear using acyclic paints, fabric paints, and liquid acrylic medium to hold the design and use of heavy paint to hold on to the fabric. In closing, while my professional journey may currently lack traditional employment experience, my dedication to my craft as an Art History major at the University of California, Riverside, shines through in my personal and commissioned work. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities I may gain in the future to apply these skills and for passions sake of my artistry and craft presenting in a more professional capacity, contributing positively to any team I join. Thank you for considering my candidacy and for future employment prospects.
